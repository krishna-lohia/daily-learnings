    "learning": "PhonePe’s payments business looks huge because UPI scale exploded, but the hard part is turning that scale into durable profits. The company built its own data centers instead of renting cloud capacity, which means it pays large upfront costs and then benefits from much lower per-transaction costs once volume is high enough. That creates operating leverage — but only if growth keeps climbing fast enough to absorb depreciation.\n\nA second hidden drag is share‑based compensation. It doesn’t require cash today, but it still dilutes shareholders and can make EBITDA look healthier than the true economic cost of running the business. In other words, PhonePe can look “profitable” on some metrics while still losing money on the bottom line.\n\nSo the real insight is that payments scale alone isn’t the finish line. PhonePe’s path to profitability depends on whether it can shift from policy‑sensitive revenue pools and subsidies toward steady merchant and financial‑services income while keeping growth high enough to justify its infrastructure bet.",

In this edition, we take a look at Goldman Sachs’ report named “Investing in Everything, Everywhere, All at Once.” The report explores how the world’s entire stock of investable assets—what Goldman calls the World Portfolio—has grown, changed, and concentrated over time, revealing how financial markets today have come to dwarf the real economy. The world portfolio is essentially the sum of all investable assets around the world; the list includes global equities, bonds, gold, and alternative assets. And let’s start with the big number: The report estimates the total value of these assets at about $261 trillion.",

The person who once bought a hatchback now wants an SUV; someone who used to drink plain curd now buys Greek yogurt; the basic toothbrush becomes an electric one. It sounds like people are simply spending more, but it’s really about something deeper: how Indian consumers are evolving, and how aspiration itself is changing shape. Premiumisation, as Ishmohit put it, is “the aspiration for a better life experience.” It’s not about chasing luxury; it’s about upgrading life in small, deliberate steps, from necessity to comfort, from function to feeling.",
